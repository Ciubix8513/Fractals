# Fractals
An OpenGL, C# based application for viewing fractals.

I'm making this for my C# class.

This is essentially an app version of shader toy with a set of shaders.

Current features:
 - Image saving
 - Max iteration control
 - Basic coloring settings
 
Current fractals:
 - Mandelbrot set (z^2 + c)  
 - Burning ship (abs(z)^2 + c)
 - Tricorn (conj(z)^2 + c)
 - Feather ((z^3 / 1 + z * z) + c)
 - Eye ((z/c)^2 - c)
